PROJECT NAME: PEACE AND JUSTICE

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The objective is to predict the number of Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards for the future years based on the historical data.

Data Description: The dataset contains State/UT-wise Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards from 2018-19 to 2020-21.

Approach:

1.Data Preprocessing: We need to clean the data, check for missing values, and handle outliers if any.
2.Feature Engineering: We need to identify the relevant features for prediction and create new features if required.
3.Splitting the Data: We need to split the data into training and testing sets.
4.Model Selection: We need to select the appropriate machine learning algorithm to build the predictive model. Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression are some of the algorithms that can be used for this task.
5.Model Evaluation: We need to evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and check for overfitting.
