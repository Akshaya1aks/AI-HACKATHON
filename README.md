PROJECT NAME: PEACE AND JUSTICE

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The objective is to predict the number of Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards for the future years based on the historical data.

Data Description: The dataset contains State/UT-wise Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards from 2018-19 to 2020-21.

Approach:

1.Data collection: Collect historical data on the number of Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards from relevant sources, such as government websites, reports, and surveys.

2.Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove any missing values, outliers, or errors. This step may also involve transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling.

3.Feature engineering: Create new features that can improve the model's performance, such as seasonal indicators or lagged variables.

4.Model selection: Select an appropriate predictive modeling technique based on the characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. Techniques that could be used include linear regression, time series analysis, or machine learning algorithms such as random forest or neural networks.

5.Model training and evaluation: Train the selected model on the historical data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared. This step may involve selecting the best model by comparing the performance of different models.

6.Model deployment: Use the trained model to predict the number of Child Care Institutions and Juvenile Justice Boards for future years based on relevant predictors, such as population growth, economic indicators, or government policies.
